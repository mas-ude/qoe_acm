\section{Methodology}

\label{sec:sysmodel}

In this section we discuss how the data sets are created that we use to create results in Section \ref{sec:results}. Most notably we use an optimization problem to calculate the optimal mean video quality while avoiding stalling events. This optimization is possible due to the fact that YouTube produces a lot of avoidable redundant traffic. The redundant traffic ratio is defined as:

\begin{equation}
	\rho = \frac{B_T-B}{B}
\end{equation}

Where $B_T$ is the total amount of data downloaded during the playback session and $B$ is the sum of the segments' sizes shown to the user.
