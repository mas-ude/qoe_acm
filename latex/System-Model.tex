\section{Methodology}

\label{sec:sysmodel}

In this section we discuss the two approaches we use to evaluate the observed adaptation from the experimental data set.
This first approach is based on regression and uses previously observed video sessions to create an estimation on how much non-redundant traffic relates to a specific average playback quality.
This has the advantage of being fast, scalable and not computational expensive. 
Furthermore, as it is based on actual observed data, it captures the dynamics of the deployed system.
We use this estimation then to calculate the maximum achievable average quality level based on the total amount of downloaded Bytes in a playback session.
The second approach is based on a mixed integer linear program (MILP) formulation. 
For this optimization problem we take the actual video segment sizes, the observed bandwidth and cumulative stallings times from the experimental data set as an input.
This gives us the optimal adaptation considering the stallings times.
In a second step, we remove the cumulative stalling times and force the optimization problem to instantly play the video.
