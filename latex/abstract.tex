In this paper, we look at YouTube's algorithm for the adaptation of the video resolution, and analyze how much more mileage can be gotten out of it. In previous work, we analyzed the efficiency of YouTube's adaptation strategy by using isotonic regression that has the disadvantage of not eliminate stalling events. As a next step, we apply use an optimization problem to provide the optimal result in any given scenario while avoiding stalling events. This paper provides an outlook on the potential that is left for improving YouTube's adaptation mechanism that is essential to managing the QoE in video streaming.
